# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with **JavaScript**, as part of the [Foundations path](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Goal

To practice writing clean and logical JavaScript functions by building a basic command-line game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## What I’ll Learn

- JavaScript functions and conditionals
- Random number generation
- Looping through rounds
- Basic user interaction with `prompt()` and `console.log()`
- (Later) DOM manipulation when UI is added

## Project Status

In progress — setting up the project structure and initial logic.

## File Structure

Stay tuned for updates as I build out the functionality and eventually upgrade to a browser-based version!
