# Rock Paper Scissors – The Odin Project

This project is part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) from The Odin Project.  
It is the **first JavaScript project**, focusing on **variables**, **functions**, **conditional logic**, and **user interaction** through the browser.

## About

This simple browser-based game lets a human player compete against the computer in a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
The game:
- Accepts the user’s input through **button clicks** (instead of `prompt()`).
- Randomly generates a computer choice.
- Tracks and displays the score live on the page.
- Plays until a result is reached.
- Declares the round winner and updates the score.
- Displays the final winner after all rounds are completed.

## Personalization

While following the core instructions, I added:
- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** with buttons for **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**.
- **Live score tracking** on the webpage, updating after each round.
- Display of **round results** (win/loss/tie) on the webpage.
- A simple layout and use of DOM manipulation to interact with the user.

This version is now fully **UI-based** and offers a more interactive experience than the original console-based version.

## What I Learned

- How to **create buttons** and interact with them using **event listeners**.
- How to **manipulate the DOM** to display results and update scores in real-time.
- How to refactor a console-based game into a **web-based application**.
- **Updating HTML elements** dynamically using JavaScript.
- Enhancing user interaction using a **graphical interface**.

## Future Enhancements

- Add an option to **reset** the game after a match.
- Include **animations** or visual feedback when a player wins or loses.
- Refactor to include more advanced features, like **best-of-three** rounds.
