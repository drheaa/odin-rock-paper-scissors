# Rock Paper Scissors – The Odin Project

This project is part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) from The Odin Project.  
It is the **first JavaScript project**, focusing on **variables**, **functions**, **conditional logic**, and basic **user interaction** through the browser.

## About

This simple browser-based game lets a human player compete against the computer in a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
The game:
- Accepts the user’s input through `prompt()`
- Randomly generates a computer choice
- Plays 5 rounds
- Tracks and displays scores
- Declares a final winner

---

## Personalization

While following the core instructions, I added:
- Modular function design for clarity
- Score tracking and console output after every round
- A final summary to declare the match winner

This version is console-based but prepares the groundwork for a UI version in the next step.

## What I Learned

- How to write and structure JavaScript functions
- How to get user input using `prompt()`
- How to generate random values with `Math.random()`
- Conditional logic to determine win/loss/tie outcomes
- Using loops to repeat logic
- Debugging with `console.log()`

## Skills Demonstrated

- JavaScript syntax & logic
- Function creation and parameter handling
- Scope awareness (global vs local variables)
- String manipulation (`.toLowerCase()`)
- Console-based interaction with users

## Future Enhancements

- Add buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors
- Update score live on the page
- Show results and round history visually
